# Tableau Project-Bank Customer Churn

## Overview

Visualization of Bank Customer Churn dataset with Tableau

## Business Task

The objective of this data analysis project was to find customer behaviours that led to churn to predict future churn and mitigate it.

## Data Source

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and it can be found here. It contains information about a bank's customers and their behaviors. It has 17 columns and 10,000 rows.

## Tools

Tableau

## Process

* I cleaned the dataset on MySQL Workbench, and the detailed explanation of the cleaning process can be found here.

* During the cleaning process on MySQL Workbench, I was able to understand what was in it and knew the parts of the data to visualize to help my analysis. I proceeded to load the dataset into Tableau and began working on it.

* On sheet 1 on Tableau, I created a pie chart to compare the number of customers who had exited (stopped doing business with) the bank and those who stayed. The visual showed that while a sizable majority keeps doing business with the bank, a large chunk of customers have exited. This is worth investigating further.
